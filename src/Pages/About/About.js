          <span>My Goal:</span> I want to be a web developer. A full stack web developer. I think i'm good in computer and technology. So, I think I
          can do it. But it took long time to develop myself as a professional web developer. Hence, There I don't take any preparation for
          competitive exam or something else, I'll spend time to build myself as a professional developer. In next 5 to 6 months, I'll try to build
          myself at least a front-end web developer. That's it.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you.</p>
